# Amazon Web Services (AWS) Concepts

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a leading cloud service provider that offers a wide range of cloud computing services. Below are some fundamental concepts to understand when working with AWS:

## 1. Regions and Availability Zones

- **Region:** A geographic area that consists of multiple Availability Zones. Each AWS region is a separate geographic area, isolated from others, and is designed to provide high availability and low latency.
- **Availability Zone (AZ):** A data center or facility within an AWS region. AZs are interconnected but physically separate from each other, providing redundancy and fault tolerance.

## 2. EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

- **EC2 Instance:** Virtual machines that you can rent on AWS. They vary in terms of computing power, memory, and storage capacity to meet different application requirements.
- **AMI (Amazon Machine Image):** A pre-configured virtual machine image used to create EC2 instances.
- **Security Groups:** Virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic to EC2 instances.
