# What is Devops ?

DevOps is a collaborative software development methodology that emphasizes automation, communication, and integration between software development and IT operations teams to deliver high-quality software rapidly and efficiently
- Devops is an evolution from the Agile model of software development.
- Easy to address gaps between both client and development  team as well as developers and operations team.

## Phases of Devops

- Plan: This phase involves defining the objectives, requirements, and timelines for software development and deployment. It includes activities such as project planning, prioritizing features, and creating a roadmap.

- Develop: In this phase, developers write code, create new features, and implement changes according to the project plan. Collaboration and version control are crucial during this stage to ensure code quality and maintainability.

- Build: The build phase involves compiling source code, running automated tests, and packaging the application for deployment. Continuous integration (CI) practices are often employed here to automate the build process and detect errors early.

- Test: Testing is performed to validate the functionality, performance, and reliability of the software. This includes unit testing, integration testing, and acceptance testing. Automated testing frameworks and tools are used to speed up this process and ensure consistent results.

- Deploy: Deployment involves releasing the application to production or staging environments. Continuous delivery (CD) practices enable automated deployment, configuration management, and rollback mechanisms to ensure smooth and reliable releases.

- Operate: Once the application is deployed, it enters the operations phase. This involves monitoring system performance, managing infrastructure, handling user feedback, and addressing any issues that arise. Continuous monitoring and feedback loops help to identify and resolve problems quickly.

- Monitor: Monitoring involves tracking the performance, availability, and usage of the application in real-time. Metrics, logs, and alerts are collected and analyzed to detect anomalies, optimize resource usage, and ensure service reliability. Continuous improvement is driven by insights gathered from monitoring data.

These phases form a continuous cycle, with feedback loops and automation mechanisms driving iterative improvements throughout the software delivery lifecycle.
